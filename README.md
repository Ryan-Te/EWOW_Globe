# Info
To see all of the images, zoom into the globe  
To see the name of an individual contestant, zoom in on them specifically until their name pops up on the top right  
The program might be a bit laggy, because processing's rendering engine is slow, especially for 3D scenes  
The full program is over 100MB, because it has to store over 10,000 contestant images  
If you want to move where you are on the globe, or upload a high res book image for me to use, DM me on discord or @ me in the TC discord  
Updates will happen hopefully after every EWOW A episode (to get updated book images), and I might also add more features!
